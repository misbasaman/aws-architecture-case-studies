# E-Commerce Modernization with AWS

Migrating an e-commerce platform from a single-server traditional hosting setup to a scalable, cost-efficient AWS cloud architecture.

### Business Problem (Before Migration)

The e-commerce company was hosted on a traditional VPS/shared server (like GoDaddy).

- Single server running Web + App + Database.
- No load balancing or auto-scaling.
- Traffic spikes (holiday sales, promotions) caused downtime & slow checkout.
- Limited disaster recovery (if the server failed, the site went offline).
- High costs to upgrade hardware just to meet occasional peak demand

### Modern AWS Architecture (After Migration)

Migrated to AWS using a Highly Available, Scalable, Cost-Optimized Architecture:
- Amazon Route 53 → DNS routing.
- Elastic Load Balancer (ALB) → Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group → Scales web/app servers up/down with demand.
- Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ) → Managed relational database, high availability with failover.
- Amazon S3 → Static content (product images, CSS, JS).
- Amazon CloudFront → CDN for global performance.
- VPC with multiple Availability Zones → Redundancy & disaster recovery.
- CloudWatch & CloudTrail → Monitoring, logging, cost tracking.
- AWS WAF & Shield → Security from attacks.

### Business Outcomes

- Scalability: Auto Scaling handles seasonal traffic spikes automatically.
- High Availability: Multi-AZ setup ensures 99.99% uptime.
- Cost Savings: Only pay for what you use (scale down during low traffic).
- Performance: Faster page loads with CloudFront CDN & S3.
- Security: Protected against DDoS and web exploits.
