# üìÑ Case Study: AWS Well-Architected Telehealth Platform

## üìå Executive Summary

This case study presents a **HIPAA-ready telehealth solution** designed using the **AWS Well-Architected Framework**. The platform enables **patients** to book appointments, view prescriptions, and attend secure telehealth sessions, while **providers** manage medical records, notes, and prescriptions.

By leveraging **HIPAA-eligible AWS services** and adhering to **FHIR R4 standards**, the system ensures compliance, scalability, and interoperability for modern healthcare delivery.

## üéØ Problem Statement

The healthcare industry faces rising demand for **secure, remote care delivery**. Traditional EHR and scheduling systems often fail to meet the needs of:

- **Patients**: frictionless booking, access to prescriptions, seamless telehealth sessions.
- **Providers**: secure access to medical history, appointment management, real-time documentation.
- **Organizations**: ensuring compliance with **HIPAA regulations** and **FHIR interoperability** standards.

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Overview

The proposed architecture is designed with **AWS HIPAA-eligible services**, ensuring **PHI protection, interoperability,** and **operational efficiency**.

### Key Features
- **Secure Patient Access**: Cognito with MFA for authentication; WAF + CloudFront for edge protection.
- **FHIR-Compliant Data**: Amazon HealthLake for standardized **FHIR R4 resources** (Patient, Encounter, MedicationRequest, DocumentReference, AuditEvent).
- **Appointments & Prescriptions**: Aurora PostgreSQL for transactional workflows.
- **Telehealth Sessions**: Amazon Chime SDK for HIPAA-ready video calls.
- **Compliance & Monitoring**: KMS, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub ensure full security visibility.

## üîê Compliance Considerations

- **HIPAA**: All services are **HIPAA-eligible** under AWS BAA. Data encrypted at rest (KMS CMKs) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- **FHIR Alignment**: HealthLake ensures **HL7 FHIR R4 compliance** for data exchange.
- **Auditability**: HealthLake resource versioning + CloudTrail logs ensure immutability and transparency.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Customer responsible for IAM policies, PHI access control, breach notification.

## üìå Mapping to AWS Well-Architected Pillars
| Pillar                     | Implementation Highlights                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Operational Excellence** | CloudWatch + CloudTrail logging, Config for compliance drift |
| **Security**               | Cognito auth, KMS encryption, GuardDuty + Security Hub       |
| **Reliability**            | Aurora Multi-AZ, S3 durability, Lambda multi-AZ              |
| **Performance Efficiency** | Serverless-first, Chime SDK low-latency video                |
| **Cost Optimization**      | Pay-per-use Lambda/API Gateway, S3 lifecycle to Glacier      |
| **Sustainability**         | Serverless + auto-scaling to minimize idle resources         |

## üöÄ Roadmap

### Phase 1 (MVP):

- Appointment booking & prescription workflow (Aurora)
- Basic telehealth video calls (Chime SDK)
- FHIR integration for Patient, Appointment, MedicationRequest

### Phase 2 (Scale-Out):

- EventBridge workflows (reminders, follow-ups)
- QuickSight dashboards on de-identified FHIR data
- Chaos Engineering for resilience testing

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Demonstrates **AWS cloud architecture expertise** with focus on **regulated industries (healthcare)**.
- Balances **scalability, compliance,** and **user experience**.
- Provides a **real-world healthcare** use case.
