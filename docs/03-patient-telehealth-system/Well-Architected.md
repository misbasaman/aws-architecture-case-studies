# 🏗️ AWS Well-Architected Framework – Telehealth Platform

This document maps the **telehealth system architecture** to the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** with the **Healthcare Industry Lens**.  

---

## 📌 Pillar 1: Operational Excellence
- **Infrastructure as Code (future phase):** Plan for Terraform or CloudFormation templates for reproducibility.  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Config provide metrics, audit logs, and compliance drift detection.  
- **Automation:** Lambda microservices + API Gateway ensure decoupled, scalable operations.  
- **Runbooks:** SNS notifications + CloudWatch alarms for operational visibility.  

---

## 📌 Pillar 2: Security
- **Identity & Access:** Cognito for patients/providers; IAM least-privilege for system roles.  
- **Data Protection:** KMS for at-rest encryption; TLS 1.2+ for in-transit encryption.  
- **Compliance:** Only HIPAA-eligible services used under a signed BAA.  
- **Threat Detection:** GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Macie for continuous monitoring.  
- **Audit:** HealthLake versioning + CloudTrail API audits + AuditEvent FHIR resources.  

---

## 📌 Pillar 3: Reliability
- **Redundancy:** Aurora Multi-AZ deployment for RDS, S3 durability (11 9’s).  
- **Failover:** Cross-AZ failover for Aurora; Lambda inherently multi-AZ.  
- **Resilience:** API Gateway throttling + retries; SQS buffers workloads.  
- **Backups:** Automated RDS snapshots, S3 versioning, HealthLake retention policies.  

---

## 📌 Pillar 4: Performance Efficiency
- **Serverless Compute:** Lambda scales on demand with patient/provider load.  
- **Content Delivery:** CloudFront reduces latency for patient-facing apps.  
- **Video:** Chime SDK optimized for low-latency video sessions.  
- **FHIR APIs:** HealthLake enables structured queries and analytics without heavy lifting.  

---

## 📌 Pillar 5: Cost Optimization
- **Pay-per-use:** Lambda, API Gateway, and Chime reduce idle costs.  
- **Storage Tiers:** S3 lifecycle policies (Standard → Glacier) for older PHI.  
- **Monitoring Costs:** CloudWatch alarms to detect unexpected spikes.  
- **Reserved Instances:** For Aurora if steady-state appointment load is predictable.  

---

## 📌 Pillar 6: Sustainability (Optional Lens)
- **Serverless-first design** reduces idle resource footprint.  
- **Auto-scaling & lifecycle management** ensure efficient use of compute/storage.  
- **Cloud-native storage (S3 + HealthLake)** avoids overprovisioning compared to on-prem equivalents.  

---

## 📌 Healthcare-Specific Lens Alignment
- **HIPAA Compliance:** All services HIPAA-eligible; requires BAA.  
- **FHIR Standardization:** HealthLake ensures interoperability with HL7 FHIR R4.  
- **Patient Privacy:** DocumentReference + Provenance ensure access control & audit trails.  
- **De-Identification:** Data pipelines can anonymize PHI for research/analytics.  

---

## ✅ Next Steps
- Add IaC templates to enforce consistent deployments.  
- Implement **Chaos Engineering** (Fault Injection Simulator) for resilience testing.  
- Expand CI/CD pipeline with security scanning (CodePipeline + CodeBuild + Inspector).
